This code demonstrates multiple regression.  It is "batch", meaning that
it trains on the full dataset in each iteration.  Gradient descent is
used to update the weights and find a globally optimal solution.
Regularization helps prevent overfitting.

The dataset is assumed to be mean normalized and scaled beforehand.
